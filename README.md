# Kink.com Coding Challenge - Frontend SASS

## SCSS
I used the 7:1 SCSS architecture for modular reasons.

## Break Points
I would normally set up mixins for break points, but with the time allotment and the fact that there are only 2 breakpoints...I just added them.

## I Pad Breakpoint - STET -
Instructions were to use 768px as the break point, but at 768 on some older versions of I Pad this doesn't quite work, perhaps the cutt off could have been 767px?
